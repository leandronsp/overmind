# Draft PR Creator

Creates or updates a draft pull request for the current branch.

## Usage

- `/pr` - Create draft PR for current branch (or update if one exists)
- `/pr <url>` - Update existing PR description

## Workflow

### 1. Ensure feature branch and commit

**NEVER commit to `main` unless the user explicitly requests it.**

```bash
git branch --show-current
git status
```

If on `main`, create and switch to a feature branch before doing anything else:

```bash
git checkout -b <type>/<short-name>
```

Branch naming follows the PR type prefix:
- `feat/` — new features
- `fix/` — bug fixes
- `refactor/` — refactoring
- `test/` — test additions
- `chore/` — maintenance
- `docs/` — documentation

Derive the branch name from the commit history or changes (e.g., `feat/spawn-and-observe`).

After ensuring you're on a feature branch, check for uncommitted changes. If there are staged or unstaged changes, commit them using conventional commit format:

```bash
git add <relevant files>
git commit -m "<type>: <description>"
```

Only proceed to the next step once all changes are committed on a feature branch.

### 2. Gather context

```bash
git log main..HEAD --oneline
git diff main...HEAD --stat
```

### 2.5. Identify source issue

If the PR was created from a `/tdd <issue>` workflow, you already have the issue number in context. Otherwise, check the branch name or commit messages for issue references.

If an issue is identified, it will be linked in the PR body using a GitHub closing keyword (see template below). When the PR is merged, GitHub automatically closes the linked issue and marks it as "completed".

### 3. Check if PR already exists

```bash
gh pr view --json number,title,body 2>/dev/null
```

### 4. Write PR description

Use the template below. Keep it concise and natural.

### 5a. If NO existing PR - Create draft PR

```bash
gh pr create --draft --title "<title>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
<body>
EOF
)"
```

### 5b. If PR already exists - Update description

```bash
gh pr edit --title "<title>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
<updated body>
EOF
)"
```

Report the PR URL to the user when done.

## PR Title Format

```
<type>: <short description>
```

Types: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`, `docs:`

Rules:
- Lowercase after prefix
- Present tense imperative ("add" not "added")
- Under 70 characters

## PR Body Template

```markdown
Closes #<issue_number>

## Summary

1-2 paragraphs explaining what this does and why.

## Changes

- Highlight 1
- Highlight 2
- Highlight 3

## Testing

- [ ] `mix test` passes
- [ ] `mix dialyzer` passes
- [ ] `mix smoke` passes
```

Omit the `Closes #...` line if there is no source issue.

## Style

- **Fluid prose** in Summary - natural writing, not robotic
- **2-3 bullet points** in Changes - highlights only, not a file list
- **No file lists** - GitHub shows that in "Files changed"

## Pipeline

```
/tdd <issue_url> -> /review-pr -> /pr -> merge
```
